//! This module defines the types and data structures for the operation queue.
//! See the crate's top-level documentation.
//!
//! The `QueuedOperation`/`ErasedQueuedOperation` traits and the `SpawnTaskFn`
//! alias are the only parts of this queue that differ between the non-`Send`
//! and `Send`-safe (`send` feature) variants, so they're the only parts kept
//! in separate submodules, selected below.

/// A queue that performs asynchronous operations in order.
//
// Design considerations:
//
//  * A previous approach involved using a `VecDeque` as the queue's inner
//    buffer, but relying on `async_channel` allows simplifying the queue's
//    structure, as well as the logic for waiting for new items to become
//    available.
//
//  * `Arc` is used to keep track of runners in a way that ensures memory is
//    properly managed. For compatibility with current Thunderbird code, the
//    queue's item type (`ErasedQueuedOperation`) does not include a bound on
//    `Send` and/or `Sync` by default, so `Rc` could be used instead there.
//    However, we plan to, at a later time, address the current thread safety
//    issues within the Thunderbird code base which currently prevent
//    dispatching runners across multiple threads. In this context, we believe
//    using `Arc` right away will avoid a hefty change in the future (at a
//    negligible performance cost).
